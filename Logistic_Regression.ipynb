        "1. What is Logistic Regression, and how does it differ from Linear\n",
        "Regression?\n",
        "  - Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a binary outcome (e.g., yes/no, 0/1, spam/not spam).\n",
        "  - Linear Regression is a regression algorithm used to predict a continuous numeric value (e.g., house price, temperature).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the role of the Sigmoid function in Logistic Regression.\n",
        "  - The sigmoid function (also called the logistic function) transforms any real-valued number into a value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as a probability.\n",
        "  - Role of Sigmoid in Logistic Regression\n",
        "  - 1. Probability Mapping\n",
        "  - 2. Binary Classification\n",

        "\n",
        "3. What is Regularization in Logistic Regression and why is it needed?\n",
        "  - Regularization is a technique used to penalize large coefficients in a model to prevent it from fitting the training data too closely (i.e., overfitting). In Logistic Regression, itâ€™s added to the loss function to control model complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What are some common evaluation metrics for classification models, and why are they important?\n",
        "  - 1. Accuracy - Proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions\n",
        " - 2. Precision - Proportion of true positives out of all predicted positives\n",
        " - 3. Recall - Proportion of true positives out of all actual positives\n",
